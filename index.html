      <p>You have a ton of photos on your laptop or desktop. You never take photos off of your phone. You have a number of increasingly larger hard drives that you backup your originals to.</p>

<p>Sync Your Photos tries to make it as simple as possible for you to have all of your photos online in one spot, as well as have a long term archive of the originals.</p>
